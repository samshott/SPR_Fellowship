search folders for xls / csv. open each one of those and look for pairs of dates and numbers (rainfall decimals). save date/rainfall/location (from filename). Check for duplicates!

```{r}

list.files(pattern = "csv$", 
           full.names = TRUE, 
           recursive = TRUE)
list.files(pattern = "hobo$")

```
